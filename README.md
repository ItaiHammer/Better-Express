# Better Express

Better Express is an NPM module for creating a custom environment with extra features for Express development.

## Installation

Globally install Better Express

```bash
npm install -g better-express
```

Create your project!

```bash
npx better-express app-name
```

## Usage

Once you installed the template project you can start up the express server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Requirements

Better express requires you to have the following software installed:

[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/s)

## Adding Routes

You can create a new route by creating a new .js file inside the `./routes/` folder with a default export that equals to a new router.

This file should look something like this:

```js
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

export default router;
```

Every file in the `./routes/` folder would automaticly be imported and used in the main express server.

If you want to change the name of the route you can also add an additional export with variable called routeName that should equal to the route name.

This should look something like this:

```js
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

export default router;
export const routeName = 'routeName';
```

If a routeName is not defined the Better Express would use the file name as the route name.

Ex:

if the file name is `hello.js` the route is going to be `/hello`.

## Public Folder

Every file in the public folder will be public and available through the `/public` route.

## Commands

When Better Express starts up it will let you use commands.

-   **restart** or **r** **-** Restarts the better express server.

-   **quit** or **q** **-** Quits the better express server.

-   **port = [New Port Number]** **-** Changes the port number.

## Nodemon

Better Express uses an NPM module called [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for restarting the server on save([Documentation](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon)).

If you have a file that you don't want nodemon to restart when it saves you can add its path to the ignore array on the `nodemon.json` file.

## About Props

You can customize your Better Express experience by changing the props! (the props are basically like settings)
In the main directory, you can find a props folder, if you open the file called `defualt.json` you can see all of the properties for the application.<br>
